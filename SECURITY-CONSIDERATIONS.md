<a id="1-injection" name="1-injection"></a>

## 1. Injection

> Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

**Mitigations in this project:**

- **Backend (Golang):**  
  - Uses GORM with parameterized queries; raw SQL is avoided where possible.  
  - Input received via HTTP APIs is validated and normalized before use. Validation is informed by the OpenAPI schema; schema-driven request validation helps prevent malformed or malicious payloads.  
  - Any dynamic query construction is done using safe builders or explicit escaping layers provided by libraries.  

- **Frontend:**  
  - Data sent to backend is constrained by client-side input controls, but authoritative validation occurs server-side.  
  - Client-generated inputs (e.g., filters, search terms) are treated as untrusted and will not be directly interpolated into server-side commands without sanitization.

<a id="2-broken-authentication" name="2-broken-authentication"></a>
## 2. Broken Authentication

> Flaws in authentication/session management can allow attackers to assume other usersâ€™ identities.

**Mitigations:**

Product-Database is a self-hosted browser application requiring no user identity and no authentication at all. The access to the product-database needs to be controlled by the hosting client. Therefore, product-database should be hosted on a reliable endpoint properly secured.

## 3. Sensitive Data Exposure

> Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection, such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when exchanged with the browser.

**Mitigations / Responsibilities:**

- **Transport:** Operators must serve the frontend and backend over HTTPS in production to protect integrity and confidentiality of data in transit. TLS termination should enforce modern cipher suites and avoid deprecated versions.  
- **Storage:** The default backend uses SQLite (typically file-based). If sensitive or private product data is stored, filesystem permissions must be hardened; consider disk-level encryption depending on threat model.  
- **Secrets / Configuration:** Any configuration parameters (e.g., app-specific config) must not be committed to source control.
- **Open Source Visibility:** Since the code is public, secrets must never be embedded in code or default configurations.

## 4. XML External Entities (XXE)

> XML parsers that process external entities can leak files or allow SSRF.

**Mitigation / Applicability:**

The core application does not perform XML processing. If future extensions introduce XML handling, ensure external entity resolution is disabled or use safe parsers.

---

<a id="5-broken-access-control" name="5-broken-access-control"></a>
## 5. Broken Access Control

> Improper enforcement of permissions allows unauthorized actions.

**Mitigations:**

There is no user-level access control (no authentication), so all endpoints are effectively public to whoever can reach them. Deployment must account for that:  
- Use network-level restrictions if the dataset or operations should not be globally accessible.  
- If access separation is later introduced, enforce authorization checks server-side, not relying on client behavior.

<a id="6-security-misconfiguration" name="6-security-misconfiguration"></a>
## 6. Security Misconfiguration

> Insecure defaults or incomplete setup exposing the system.

**Mitigations / Recommendations:**

- Operators should separate environments (development vs. production) and disable verbose debugging in production.  
- Do not expose internal diagnostics, stack traces, or debug endpoints publicly.  
- Keep dependencies updated and run automated scans for misconfigurations or outdated components.  
- Validate that the OpenAPI schema and implementation are in sync

<a id="7-cross-site-scripting-xss" name="7-cross-site-scripting-xss"></a>
## 7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

> Execution of untrusted scripts in the browser context.

**Mitigations:**

- **Frontend:** Built with React, which auto-escapes interpolated content. Avoid use of raw HTML insertion; if required, sanitize before use.  
- **Third-party components (HeroUI etc.):** Used as intended without bypassing their safe rendering primitives.  
- **Reflected Data:** Any data that originates from user input and is rendered should be treated cautiously, with proper encoding/escaping.

---

<a id="8-insecure-deserialization" name="8-insecure-deserialization"></a>
## 8. Insecure Deserialization

> Processing untrusted serialized data leading to logic compromise.

**Mitigations:**

- JSON payloads are parsed using standard libraries in both frontend and backend; no unsafe custom deserialization layers are used.

<a id="9-using-components-with-known-vulnerabilities" name="9-using-components-with-known-vulnerabilities"></a>
## 9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

> Vulnerable third-party libraries may undermine the application.

**Mitigations:**

- Versioned dependency management:  
  - JavaScript: Lockfile (e.g., `package-lock.json` or equivalent) ensures reproducible installs
  - Go: `go.mod`/`go.sum` manage module versions
- Dependabot is used for automatic update notifications
- Review critical transitive dependencies, especially those involved in parsing, serialization, and any user-input handling.  
- Avoid running untrusted plugins or extensions that could introduce new vulnerable components without review

<a id="10-insufficient-logging--monitoring" name="10-insufficient-logging--monitoring"></a>
## 10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

> Lack of visibility delays detection of incidents.

**Mitigations:**

- **Backend:**  
  - Logs input validation failures, unexpected errors, requests, and background job (Fuego) statuses including retries/failures

- **Frontend:**  
  - Surface user-facing errors without exposing internal stack traces
