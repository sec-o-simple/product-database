# Product Database – Server

This is the **API Server** for the Product Database. It is built with Go and provides a RESTful JSON API for managing product data.

## Technologies Used

- **Go 1.24+**
- [**Fuego**](https://github.com/go-fuego/fuego) – lightweight HTTP framework
- [**GORM**](https://gorm.io/) – ORM for PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.
- [**go-playground/validator**](https://github.com/go-playground/validator) – request validation
- [**Air**](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) – live reload during development

| Command      | Description                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `make dev`   | Start the server with **Air** (hot reload) |
| `make run`   | Run the server once without reload         |
| `make test`  | Run unit tests with race detector          |
| `make fmt`   | Run `gofmt` on all source files            |
| `make build` | Build a production binary in `./bin/`      |
| `make clean` | Remove the binary and temp files           |

## OpenAPI Specification

The API is fully documented via **OpenAPI**, automatically generated by Fuego.

After running the server, you can find the spec at:

```
http://localhost:9999/swagger/openapi.json
```

You can also access the interactive Swagger UI at:

```
http://localhost:9999/swagger/
```

The specification is also available in the `doc/` directory as `openapi.json` and can be used for automatic generation of client libraries.

## Deployment

To build a binary for deployment:

```sh
make build
```

The binary will be available at `./bin/server`.
